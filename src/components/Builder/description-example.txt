Write a description for your deck. Start with an introduction outlining the deck victory conditions and general game plan. You can stress **important concepts** but don't *overdo* it.

Leave a blank line between paragraphs.

Switch to the "Preview" tab to see a rendering of your write-up.

# Notables card choices

Use dashes to create a list. Here is how you can create a link to a card:

- Start by typing "[]()" where you want to insert the link
- Copy the card link between the parentheses "()"; on most desktop browsers you can drag-n-drop the link from the deck
- Copy the card name between the brackets "[]"
- The result must look like this: [Young Rumormonger](https://fiveringsdb.com/card/young-rumormonger). It will be rendered as a nice link.

## Dynasty Deck

Use subsections to give a structure to your write-up and make it more readable.
